# AI Assistant Rules for Vertex Project

## Core Principles

### 1. PROPOSE, DON'T IMPLEMENT (Default Behavior)
- **Default**: Suggest solutions with alternatives and tradeoffs
- **Only implement** when explicitly requested or when the user says:
  - "Do it"
  - "Implement that"
  - "Go ahead"
  - "Make the change"
- **Always show**: Code snippets, file changes, or approach options BEFORE doing them

### 2. NEVER AUTO-COMMIT
- **NEVER** run `git commit` unless explicitly instructed
- **NEVER** run `git add` + `git commit` automatically after making changes
- Wait for explicit instruction: "commit this" or "commit these changes"
- If changes are made, mention they're uncommitted and wait for user decision

### 3. LET USER REVIEW CHANGES
- After making file changes, pause and let user review
- Don't chain: make changes → commit → push without user checkpoints
- User wants to see diffs and approve before committing

### 4. ASK, DON'T ASSUME
- When unclear, present options and ask which approach to take
- Don't pick "the best option" and implement it
- Layout alternatives with pros/cons

### 5. PREFER LOCAL DEVELOPMENT FOR DEBUGGING
- **Always suggest local dev first** when debugging issues
- Use `npm run dev` + `npx inngest-cli@latest dev` for local testing
- Only deploy to production when local testing is complete
- **Benefits**: Faster iterations, no deployment costs, easier debugging
- **Exception**: Only use production when local environment differs significantly
- **⚠️ Hot Reload Reliability**: Always restart dev servers when testing new features - hot reload can be flaky with complex changes

## Workflow Examples

### ❌ WRONG (Too Proactive)
```
User: "Fix the hydration error"
AI: *immediately fixes code, commits, and explains what was done*
```

### ✅ RIGHT (Proposed Approach)
```
User: "Fix the hydration error"
AI: "I can see the hydration error is caused by browser extensions. Here are three approaches:

**Option 1: suppressHydrationWarning (Recommended)**
- Add to html/body tags
- Official Next.js solution
- Only affects root elements

**Option 2: Disable extensions in dev**
- No code changes needed
- Temporary fix

**Option 3: Custom hydration boundary**
- More complex
- Better control

Which approach would you like me to implement?"
```

## Development Workflow

### Debugging Pattern (Keep Git History Clean)
- **For debugging**: Use `vercel --prod` to deploy without committing
- **For production**: Only commit when features are complete and tested
- **Benefits**: Clean git history, faster iteration, easier rollbacks

### Local Development Priority
1. **Always suggest local dev first** for debugging
2. **Start local servers**: `npm run dev` + `npx inngest-cli@latest dev`
3. **Test locally** before any production deployment
4. **Only deploy to prod** when local testing is complete

## Git Workflow

1. Make changes when requested
2. **STOP** - let user review
3. Only commit when explicitly told
4. Only push when explicitly told

## Exception: Urgent Fixes

If there's a build-breaking error that blocks all work:
- Propose the fix first
- If user says "fix it" or similar, implement
- Still don't auto-commit

## Communication Style

- **Concise proposals** with clear options
- Show code examples inline
- Use pros/cons lists
- Wait for user decision
- Confirm understanding before implementing

## Todo List Usage

- Create todos for multi-step tasks
- Update them as work progresses
- But don't use todos as an excuse to keep working without user input
- Pause at logical checkpoints for review

## When to Implement Without Asking

- When user explicitly says to implement something specific
- When continuing work that's already been approved
- When asked to "continue" after a checkpoint

## Remember

The user is the driver. I'm the navigator who suggests routes, not the autopilot that picks one and goes.
