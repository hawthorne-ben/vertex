# Local Development Limitations

## Issue: Page Hangs During Processing

### What's Happening

When processing large files locally, you may experience:
- ‚úÖ Progress bar updates normally (reaches 100%)
- ‚ùå Page hangs/loads indefinitely on refresh
- ‚ùå Browser feels unresponsive during processing

### Root Cause

**Node.js Single-Threaded Event Loop**

In local development:
1. **Next.js dev server** runs in Node.js (single thread)
2. **Inngest dev server** connects to the same process
3. **Heavy database operations** block the event loop
4. **Page requests** can't be processed while event loop is blocked

This is a **local development limitation only** - it doesn't happen in production.

### Why It Doesn't Happen in Production

| Environment | Architecture | Result |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Local Dev** | Next.js + Inngest in same Node process | ‚ùå Blocking |
| **Production** | Next.js (Vercel) + Inngest (Cloud) in separate containers | ‚úÖ No blocking |

In production:
- Inngest runs in **separate infrastructure**
- Never blocks your Next.js server
- Page loads are always fast

## Mitigations Implemented

### 1. Explicit Event Loop Yielding

Added `setImmediate` after each batch to give control back:
```typescript
await new Promise(resolve => setImmediate(resolve))
```

**Impact**: Reduces blocking, but doesn't eliminate it completely

### 2. Smaller Batch Sizes in Dev

```typescript
const BATCH_SIZE = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 50000 : 10000
```

**Impact**: 
- More frequent yields (5x more often)
- Faster batch completion
- Better responsiveness

### 3. Faster INSERT Operations

Replaced slow UPSERT with fast INSERT:
```typescript
// Before: 25 seconds per 5k batch
.upsert(rows, { onConflict: '...', ignoreDuplicates: true })

// After: 1-2 seconds per 10k batch
.insert(rows)
```

**Impact**: 
- 10x faster processing
- Less time blocking event loop

## Developer Workflow

### Best Practices

**During Processing (Local Dev)**:
1. ‚úÖ Upload file and start processing
2. ‚úÖ Monitor progress in browser console
3. ‚úÖ Check Inngest logs at http://localhost:8288
4. ‚ùå **Don't refresh the page** while processing
5. ‚úÖ Wait for status to change to "ready"
6. ‚úÖ Then refresh to see final result

**If Page Hangs**:
- Wait for processing to complete (check Inngest logs)
- Or restart both dev servers (Ctrl+C both, then restart)
- Page will become responsive once processing completes

### Alternative: Use Inngest Cloud for Dev

**Setup Inngest Cloud Dev Environment**:
1. Go to https://app.inngest.com
2. Create a "dev" branch/environment
3. Get dev event key and signing key
4. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=your_dev_event_key
   INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=your_dev_signing_key
   ```
5. Restart dev server

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ No blocking issues
- ‚úÖ Same behavior as production
- ‚úÖ Better local development experience
- ‚ùå Requires internet connection
- ‚ùå Small latency for function invocation

### Test on Production

**For final validation**:
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
git add .
git commit -m "test: validate processing performance"
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys in ~2 minutes
# Test on https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**Production behavior**:
- ‚úÖ No blocking
- ‚úÖ Can refresh anytime
- ‚úÖ Page loads instantly
- ‚úÖ True production performance

## Expected Performance

| Metric | Local Dev | Production |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Batch size** | 10,000 | 50,000 |
| **Batch time** | 1-2 seconds | 0.5-1 second |
| **50MB file** | ~5 minutes | ~2 minutes |
| **Page blocking** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes | ‚úÖ No |
| **Progress updates** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

## Monitoring

### Check Processing Status

**Browser Console**:
```
üìà File sample_50mb.csv progress: 10,000 samples
üìà File sample_50mb.csv progress: 20,000 samples
```

**Inngest Dev Dashboard**:
- http://localhost:8288
- Real-time function execution
- Step-by-step progress
- Error details

**Server Logs**:
```
‚úÖ Batch 1 processed: 10000 samples in 1234ms (10000 total)
üìä Progress checkpoint updated: 10000 samples
```

## Summary

**Key Takeaway**: Page hanging during processing is a **local dev limitation only**.

**Solutions** (pick one):
1. ‚úÖ **Accept limitation** - don't refresh during processing (easiest)
2. ‚úÖ **Use Inngest Cloud** - no blocking, better DX (recommended)
3. ‚úÖ **Test on Vercel** - true production behavior (for final validation)

In production, this issue **does not exist** - Inngest runs separately and never blocks your Next.js server.
